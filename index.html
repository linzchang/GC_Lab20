      <p>Welcome!  I am a software developer in training at Quicken Loans.  I'm currently learning C# .Net at Grand Circus.</p>

        <p>I was born in Charleston, SC and moved to Toledo, OH when I was four years old.
          I grew up in the '90s surrounded by corn fields. During the school year I collected gel pens and tried to keep my Tamagatchi alive,
          and I spent summer days trading Pokemon cards between super-soaker fights.</p>
        <p>I first learned to code in middle school, if making MySpace and NeoPets layouts counts as web-design.
          I graduated from Perrysburg High School in 2009 and attended college at Bowling Green State University.</p>
        <p>I graduatedin 2013 from BGSU with a bachelor of science, majoring in Environmental Science.</p>
        <p>I moved to Michigan in 2016 and started my career at the Rock FOC at Amrock (formerly Title Source) in Title Production.
        I am now a member of Dev.Build 2.0 at Quicken Loans, learning software development skills.</p>

      <p>I spend most of my free-time chasing after my puppy Zoey, or catering to cats' (Harrison and Kingsley) every need.</p>
      <p>When I escape the animals, I like to watch Game of Thrones and This Is Us.</p>
